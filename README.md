# Lumenia

> **Send and request money by link — the recipient claims it walletless, seedless, and the recipient pays no gas, in a target ~30 seconds.**
> On Stellar, with native USDC. Every claim creates a new funded Stellar account.

Lumenia — from Stellar's lumens: light (value) that travels by link. It is a consumer payments app that lets **an ordinary person use Stellar's invisible infrastructure (anchors, USDC, sponsorship) just by tapping a WhatsApp link.** No one needs to know anything about crypto.

**Context:** Built for [SCF Build (Integration Track)](https://stellar.gitbook.io/scf-handbook) + Instawards (Stellar ambassador, 30-day MVP).

## 1. Problem

In crypto, **even to receive money** you first have to set up a wallet, save a seed phrase, and hold a token for the transaction fee (gas). For a normal person this is an absurd wall. Telling someone "I'll send you 20 dollars" means putting the other party through a half-hour crypto setup ordeal.

The result: stablecoins (USDC) are cheap and fast but **can't reach ordinary people's hands.** The pain isn't in "sending money," it's in **"the recipient being able to receive the money without knowing anything."**

Especially in emerging markets (Turkey and the Turkish diaspora), people want to hold dollars, send money home, and split group expenses — but all the tools require either crypto literacy or banking friction.

---

## 2. Solution

Lumenia offers two core flows:

- **Send by link (hero flow):** You send someone a link → the recipient taps, confirms with their face (biometric) → USDC is in their pocket in a target ~30 seconds. They don't set up a wallet, never see a seed phrase, and **the recipient pays no gas.**
- **Request money (differentiation + retention layer):** You request money from someone → a link goes to the other party → they tap it and pay → and now **they too have a wallet + a balance.**

At no point does the user feel a "crypto" step. They think in lira; behind the scenes it settles in USDC.

**What it is NOT:** Not a savings/interest product (no yield), not a bank, not an exchange. Just **person-to-person money movement.**

---

## 3. How it works

### 3.1 Claim flow (sending by link)

   │                                   │                              │
   │            4. SPONSOR SERVICE atomic sandwich (fee-bump):        │
   │            beginSponsoring → createAccount(0 XLM) →              │
   │            changeTrust(USDC) → claimClaimableBalance →           │
   │            endSponsoring                                         │
   │                                   │─────────────────────────────▶│
   │                                   │        USDC in pocket, 0 XLM │
```

**Important:** The money never sits on our server. **The Stellar ledger escrows it** (Claimable Balance). The sponsor service only pays for account creation + the transaction fee; it can never touch the user's money.

### 3.2 Request money flow

On Stellar there is **no pull/debit (automatic collection).** "Request money" = a **SEP-7 payment link** is generated; the payer opens it, sees the amount, confirms, and **pushes** it. No one can pull money from anyone without their knowledge — this isn't a constraint, it's a **trust feature** ("you won't get a surprise charge").

### 3.3 Recovery (device change / loss)

Keeping a classic Ed25519 key only in browser memory is catastrophic (if the data is wiped, the money is gone). Instead:
- A key is derived from the **PRF output of a WebAuthn passkey** → the Ed25519 secret is encrypted with **AES-256-GCM** → the ciphertext is stored on the server → with the user's platform passkey (iCloud/Google) it is **synced/recovered across devices.**
- Because the WhatsApp in-app browser blocks passkey creation, the **Argon2id password-based fallback is the primary path**, and PRF is the upgrade offered on a real browser.

## 4. Architectural decisions and why

This section is the heart of the project: every major decision and **why** it was made that way. Rationales are detailed in [stack.md](stack.md). Each decision was stress-tested via an adversarial multi-lens AI review: the **technical decisions are locked**, while the **product/strategy decisions remain provisional bets**.

### Decision 1 — Not React Native, but a **web-first PWA**
**Why:** The essence of Lumenia is a **link.** A link opens wherever the user taps it (WhatsApp in-app browser, Safari, Chrome). Saying "go to the App Store first to receive the money" kills the funnel — that's the exact opposite of the "30 seconds, zero setup" promise. Also WebAuthn/passkey is **first-class on the web**, whereas in React Native it's polyfill hell (`createKeypair` blows up in RN, requiring crypto/Buffer shims). A Next.js PWA = a single codebase, both a powerful web app and a mobile app installed via "Add to Home Screen." If a true native app is needed, we move to Expo in v2. **Web-first also keeps the passkey door open for v2.**

### Decision 2 — Not a Soroban smart-account, but **classic Ed25519 (v1)**
**Why:** "A Face ID, seedless wallet" is a UX promise, not a cryptographic one. Keeping a classic Ed25519 key in the device's secure enclave and unlocking it with biometrics is **indistinguishable** from a real passkey in the experience the user lives — and it ships in 30 days. A true passkey smart-account (OpenZeppelin Smart Accounts), on the other hand, requires a factory contract + relayer + Soroban-token balances + RN native modules; SDF's own relayer (Launchtube) says "prototype, no SLA." **The "Zero XLM" feature already comes from sponsorship, not from the account type** — meaning it's achievable today even with a classic account. Smart-account = v2 (for recovery + multi-device); placing the `RecipientAccount` interface in v1 makes the migration cheap.
> Note: the `passkey-kit` library says in its README "demo only, not audited, do not use to protect anything" → an app that holds money is not built on top of it.

### Decision 3 — Custody: **sender-funded Claimable Balance + sponsor backend**
**Why:** Choosing the right primitive for "let the walletless recipient claim the money" is critical.
- **Claimable Balance** is Stellar's native escrow (it provides at the protocol level what Peanut does on EVM with a smart contract + relayer). With a dual predicate (recipient `unconditional` + sender `reclaim-after-7-days`), **both parties are non-custodial**: the ledger holds the money, not us.
- **But** the CB alone isn't enough: the claiming account must be funded + have a trustline. This is exactly what the **sponsor service** solves — in an atomic sandwich it sponsors the recipient's account and trustline and fee-bumps, and the recipient ends up with **0 XLM.**
- **Why a backend is mandatory:** there is no client-only "magic claim"; someone has to pay the account-creation reserve and the transaction fee. The sponsor key **only pays for create/fund + fee, can never spend principal** → the service stays non-custodial.
- **Rejected alternatives:** a "holding account" where the backend holds USDC = custodial (the thing we avoid). The "deterministic address" (SDP/Meridian) pattern = actually the Soroban smart-wallet path, which we're not taking in v1.

### Decision 4 — Hero flow: **link-send first**, request-money as the differentiation + retention layer
**Why (PM review correction):** Two flows, two jobs. **Link-send is the hero** because it delivers first value fastest — the recipient taps a link and **sees money in a target ~30 seconds**, the shortest path to an "aha" moment on first run. **Request-money is the differentiator + retention layer**, not the first-run hero: even a user with zero balance can initiate a request, the request creates demand that pulls money + a new user onto the network, and crypto universally leaves request-money underbuilt (even Venmo is bad at uneven splits). The retention engine (since yield is forbidden): **the "chase down who owes you" loop** — the strongest organic return hook in P2P. So link-send wins the first run; request-money wins the long game.

### Decision 5 — Corridor: **EU→TR inbound** (off-ramp deferred)
**Why:** Research surfaced a bombshell: **there is no live Stellar-native TRY off-ramp in Turkey.** Cash-out is two-hop (USDC→CEX→TRY), the CEXes' acceptance of Stellar-USDC is unverified, and MASAK imposes a 72h delay + $3k/day cap on the first withdrawal → "instantly spendable" breaks. The solution: **defer the off-ramp in v1**, let USDC circulate internally (1-cohort runway), and **pivot to the leg that works** — EU→TR inbound (diaspora remittance), with MyKobo (EURC/SEPA) the only solid anchor. Same community, reverse direction: now the working leg (the sender) is also the paying/motivated leg. CEX cash-out = a documented "safety valve," not the hero flow.

### Decision 6 — Notifications: **WhatsApp-first**, not SMS
**Why:** Turkey's SMS market is hostile to this use-case: P2P content is banned, and starting April 2026 a non-resident sender can't send an SMS with a URL to a TR number (the whole product is a link!). WhatsApp's penetration in Turkey is very high + utility templates are free within a 24h window. Web push, meanwhile, is for the installed PWA (on iOS, home-screen installation is required).

### Decision 7 — **No-yield, non-custodial** (regulation)
**Why:** SCF legal teams flag three things: returns/yield (securities/deposit risk), tokenized securities, and prediction/betting. Custody also brings money-transmitter classification. That's why Lumenia is strictly non-custodial (ledger escrow) and **never uses a "savings/interest/bank" framing** — only "money movement." We leave the regulated part of money transfer to licensed anchors/CEXes.

### Decision 8 — Take the Stellar Wallet SDK as **infrastructure**, write the core on top
**Why:** The mentor's advice is right — the Wallet SDK wipes out anchor/ramp (SEP-6/24/10/12) and account/signing boilerplate (the most painful part, which is the real risk on the cash-out side). **But** the SDK does **not** give passkey/smart-wallet or sponsored-claim logic (classic Ed25519). So the SDK handles ~70%; the differentiating 30% (sponsored claim + request-money + link mechanics) is the core we write ourselves with `@stellar/stellar-sdk`.

## 5. Tech stack

Full pinned list and rationales: **[stack.md](stack.md)**. Summary:

| Layer | Choice |
|---|---|
| **Frontend** | Next.js 16 PWA + Serwist (`@serwist/turbopack`), `next/og` dynamic claim cards, TypeScript |
| **Identity** | Classic Ed25519 keypair; encrypted recovery with WebAuthn PRF + Argon2id (`@simplewebauthn` 13.x) |
| **Chain** | `@stellar/stellar-sdk@16.0.0` (sponsored-reserve sandwich + fee-bump); `@stellar/typescript-wallet-sdk@3` (SEP flows) |
| **Custody** | Sender-funded Claimable Balance (dual predicate) — ledger escrow, non-custodial |
| **Backend** | Separate Node sponsor service; sponsor key in KMS (AWS KMS Ed25519 / Dfns / Turnkey); anti-drain allowlist + rate-limit |
| **DB** | Postgres (claim link `hash`, request state, off-chain split ledger, encrypted key blobs) |
| **Notifications** | WhatsApp Business API (primary) + web push |
| **Asset / Network** | Native Circle USDC · testnet → mainnet |

**Why these versions:** `next-pwa` is dead → Serwist is the standard. `stellar-sdk@16` (not v14) because the `rpc`/sponsorship/fee-bump APIs are the same and v14 is two majors behind for no reason. AWS KMS has done Ed25519 raw-sign since November 2025 → secure custody of the sponsor key is possible.

## 6. Project structure

```
lumenia/  (pnpm workspaces)
├── apps/
│   ├── web/         → Next.js 16 PWA (PUBLIC, no secrets)
│   └── sponsor/     → separate Node service (HOT Ed25519 sponsor key, KMS)
│       └── src/
│           ├── spike1b-kms-rawsign.ts → AWS KMS Ed25519 raw-sign proof

├── packages/

└── README.md        → this document
```

> Note: the working directory is historically named `faceid-wallet`; the project/monorepo root is `lumenia`.

**Why two separate services:** The sponsor backend holds a hot signing key + KMS → it must have its own network/IAM boundary and its own deploy cadence; putting it in the same place as the public edge PWA is the wrong blast-radius.

---

## 7. Getting started

> The monorepo skeleton **exists** — the spikes below run today (all on testnet except the anti-drain validator test, which runs locally).

```bash
# Requirements: Node 20+, pnpm, a Postgres, a testnet sponsor key
pnpm install

# Day-1 spikes (run today)
pnpm spike1          # sponsor economics: sponsored 0-XLM create + changeTrust + fee-bump + claim (testnet)
pnpm spike1b         # AWS KMS Ed25519 raw-sign proof (testnet)
pnpm spike1c         # web→sponsor XDR wire-parity proof (testnet)
pnpm test:antidrain  # anti-drain validator tests (local)
```

Environment variables (draft, for the **not-yet-built HTTP service**): `STELLAR_NETWORK=testnet`, `RPC_URL`, `SPONSOR_KMS_KEY_ID`, `USDC_ASSET`, `DATABASE_URL`, `WHATSAPP_TOKEN`, `WEBAUTHN_RP_ID`.

---

## 8. Day-1 spikes

Three gates that must pass before writing any feature code (if one fails, the architecture changes):

1. **Sponsor economics:** on testnet, does a sponsored 0-XLM `createAccount` + `changeTrust` + fee-bump + `claim` with KMS-Ed25519 return `SUCCESS`? Is a malicious inner tx **rejected** (anti-drain)?
2. **PRF round-trip:** on real iOS Safari 18.4+ and Android Chrome, is keygen → PRF → encrypt → store → recover → signature accepted by the network?
3. **WhatsApp flow:** link → OG card render → claim in the WhatsApp in-app browser → does the **Argon2id fallback trigger automatically**?

> 🔑 **The single most critical validation (non-code, 1 afternoon):** Does any Turkish CASP (BTCTurk/Paribu) accept USDC over the **Stellar network**? If not, a bridge step is added to cash-out. The entire corridor decision branches on this — **test it first.**

---

## 9. Known risks

| Risk | Mitigation |
|---|---|
| **Turkey off-ramp broken** (no Turkish CASP confirmed to accept USDC on the *Stellar* network; MASAK ~$3k/day cap + 72h first withdrawal) | Off-ramp framed honestly as a **next-milestone infrastructure bet, not solved**. Mitigation: **CCTP is live on Stellar (~May 2026)** → bridge Stellar-USDC to a chain a TR CASP accepts, or a **USDC-funded card** (RedotPay/KAST). v1 leans on internal circulation + EU→TR inbound. |
| **WhatsApp webview blocks passkey** | Argon2id primary recovery, PRF upgrade |
| **Sponsor service single choke-point** | **AWS KMS Ed25519 raw-sign is now available (since 2025-11-07) and proven mechanically (Spike #1b)**; anti-drain validator hardened to op SOURCE+PARAMETER level (**18/18 unit + 5/5 integration tests**, gating the live `/feebump`); web→sponsor XDR **wire-parity proven (Spike #1c + live browser claim)**; plus per-IP/per-account rate-limit + fee cap. |
| **Competitor: Sling Money** ($15M, Solana) | Corridor strategy; being a global competitor; frame Sling as validation |
| **Regulation (MASAK/CASP)** | Strictly non-custodial; leave off-ramp to a licensed CEX; lawyer before mainnet |
| **Serwist + Turbopack** newest combo | Day-1 spike; fallback `--webpack` |

Detailed risk table and the "mempool-class" assumption traps that were caught: [stack.md §2](stack.md).

---

## 10. Roadmap

**v1 — Instaward MVP (30 days, testnet)** — ruthlessly scoped to the hero flow (PM review):
- Sponsor backend (sponsored create + fee-bump; KMS Ed25519 signer)
- **Link-send claim flow** (Claimable Balance) — the hero
- PWA claim page + dynamic OG cards (`next/og`)
- **Argon2id recovery only** (value-first: show the money before asking for a credential)
- North-star metric: **net-new funded recipients that take a retained second action** (raw address count is sybil-gameable, so it is gated on unique-human + a retained action)

**v1.5 — SCF Build** (deferred out of v1 to keep the 30-day scope honest):
- **Request-money** (SEP-7) + **uneven splits** (off-chain ledger) — the retention layer
- **WhatsApp auto-notifications** (Business API) + **PRF recovery upgrade**
- EU→TR inbound on-ramp (MyKobo EURC/SEPA + on-chain EURC→USDC swap)
- Mainnet, real USDC
- _claim-to-second-action ≥ 25% as a retention hypothesis to measure (not a v1 success gate)_

**v2**
- Migration to OZ Smart Accounts (real passkey signer, social recovery, multi-device)
- "Send to phone" (deterministic address, no link needed)
- Integrated TRY cash-out if validated

---

## 11. Why Stellar

**NOT cheap/fast fees** (Solana/Base match those). The real muscle is **the stack itself**: native Claimable Balances (escrow without a smart contract) + protocol-level Sponsored Reserves (the recipient pays no gas — zero XLM — with no custom relayer) + passkey + native USDC. To do this, Peanut sets up a vault contract + relayer on every chain; Stellar gives it in the protocol.

**But we're not a monopoly** — Daimo/Peanut offer walletless claim links (sponsor-paid fees) on other chains. The honest positioning: not *"only possible on Stellar,"* but **"zero custom-contract risk + zero setup for the recipient + native USDC + EM rails — and the social primitive that Stellar's consumer ecosystem is missing."** Value metric for SCF: **net-new funded Stellar addresses created via claim** (not TVL — ecosystem activation).

---

## 12. Competitors

| Product | Chain | Status |
|---|---|---|
| **The recipient's own Turkish bank app** (FAST + Kolay Adres) | — (domestic banking) | The real **do-nothing alternative**: instant, free, domestic. For money already inside Turkey, this beats us — we don't try to win the domestic leg. |
| **Morse** (ex-Sling Money) | Solana | Ships the **same link UX**, MiCA-licensed, Turkey in **closed beta** — same EM thesis, different chain. The biggest threat. |
| **Peanut Protocol** | EVM (20+) | The exact same mechanic, but locked to EVM, infra-flavored. Not on Stellar. |
| **Daimo** | ETH + rollup | The best "request money" UX in crypto — but pivoted to B2B. |
| **LOBSTR** | Stellar | A close threat with a **thin moat**: it **already** sends to email/phone with a claimable-balance claim. Still account-leaning rather than a fully walletless Face-ID claim, but the gap is small. |

**Lumenia's honest edge:** the **cross-border EU→TR leg** + an **open, shareable claim link** (not a closed in-app transfer). The moat is **distribution, not technology** — the mechanic is proven and copyable.

**Verdict:** claim-link is **crowded on EVM, funded on Solana (Morse), and nearly EMPTY on Stellar.** The mechanic is proven, the chain lane is open, the moat = distribution.

*Network: testnet-first · Regulation: no-yield, non-custodial*
