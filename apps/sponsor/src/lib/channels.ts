/**
 * Channel-account pool — the C1 concurrency fix.
 *
 * PROBLEM: the sponsor builds onboarding txs with tx.source = sponsor, so its ONE
 * sequence number serializes every concurrent claim → a viral link → tx_bad_seq for
 * everyone but the first (proven by spike8: 1/20 succeed).
 *
 * FIX: a POOL of sponsor-controlled "channel" accounts, each LENDING its sequence
 * number to one concurrent onboarding. Different concurrent requests use different
 * channels → independent sequences → no collision (spike8: 20/20, 0 tx_bad_seq). This
 * is the exact pattern in Stellar's official "channel accounts" guide.
 *
 * WORKERS REALITY: the sponsor is a Cloudflare Worker; isolates don't share memory,
 * so an in-memory free-list is unsafe under the exact viral load we're fixing. Two
 * isolates could hand out the same channel + sequence. Coordination therefore uses an
 * EXCLUSIVE LEASE in the shared store (the same Upstash Redis the rate-limiter uses):
 * `SET chan:<pub> <token> NX EX <ttl>` is atomic across isolates — exactly one wins.
 * The lease value is a per-lease TOKEN so release() is FENCED (compare-and-delete): a
 * slow isolate whose lease already TTL-expired cannot delete a successor's fresh lease.
 *
 * WHY A LEASE (not a reserved-sequence counter): the create-account client submits the
 * tx itself, and the sequence is BAKED into the XDR the client signs — the server can't
 * retry with a fresh sequence without a re-sign. A monotonic counter would jam on the
 * first abandoned handout (a gap poisons every later sequence). So each channel serves
 * ONE in-flight onboarding at a time (exclusive lease). The lease TTL MUST exceed the
 * tx's timebound, so an abandoned (never-submitted) handout's tx is dead (tx_too_late)
 * before the channel is reused — otherwise a late submit could still land and collide.
 * INVARIANT: any tx built on a leased channel MUST carry maxTime < the lease TTL, and
 * the channel's sequence MUST be read FRESH from chain at each lease (never cached).
 *
 * Empty CHANNEL_SECRETS ⇒ the pool is disabled and callers fall back to the
 * sponsor-sourced path (backward compatible — never worse than today).
