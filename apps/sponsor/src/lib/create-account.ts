/**
 * /create-account — sponsored 0-XLM onboarding.
 *
 * Builds the sponsored-reserve sandwich that gives a brand-new recipient an
 * account + a USDC trustline while they hold 0 XLM (the sponsor covers both
 * reserves and the fee):
 *
 *   beginSponsoringFutureReserves(sponsoredId=recipient)   [source: sponsor]
 *   createAccount(destination=recipient, startingBalance=0) [source: sponsor]
 *   changeTrust(USDC)                                       [source: recipient]
 *   endSponsoringFutureReserves()                           [source: recipient]
 *
 * TX SOURCE — two paths (C1 fix):
 *  • CHANNEL path (when CHANNEL_SECRETS is configured): tx.source = a leased CHANNEL
 *    account, so its independent sequence number serves this onboarding. Different
 *    concurrent claims lease different channels → no tx_bad_seq collision (the sponsor's
 *    single sequence no longer serializes everyone). The channel pays the tiny classic
 *    fee (it is sponsor-funded, so value never leaves the sponsor); the sponsor still
 *    sources + signs begin/createAccount (the reserves) — it never gives up authority.
 *    The client submits the tx, so the lease is HELD (not released) — its TTL guards
 *    reuse until the handout is submitted or dead (see lib/channels.ts).
 *  • SPONSOR path (fallback, and the original behavior): tx.source = sponsor. Used when
 *    no channel is configured/free — never worse than before.
 *
 * The recipient account does not exist yet, so it cannot provide a sequence number; the
 * sponsor pays the fee directly on the sponsor path (no fee-bump needed here — fee-bump
 * is the /feebump claim path, where tx.source = recipient). The sponsor signs its half;
 * the recipient co-signs `changeTrust`+`end` on-device, then submits.
 *
 * The sponsor BUILDS this tx itself from a single untrusted input (the recipient public
 * key), so there is nothing client-supplied to anti-drain-validate here; the allowlist
 * validator guards the /feebump path, where the client builds the tx.
