/**
 * /sweep — consolidate an incoming per-link account into the user's ONE home
 * account (see docs/RECOVERY_ARCHITECTURE.md; proven on-chain by Spike #7).
 *
 * The CLIENT (the per-link throwaway account) builds + signs ONE inner tx it
 * sources itself. Two accepted shapes (the throwaway holds 0 XLM throughout):
 *   3-op (already-claimed — the PRODUCTION shape, since the frozen /c/[id] route
 *         claims the CB at claim time, leaving plain USDC):
 *     payment(USDC → home) → changeTrust(USDC, 0) → accountMerge(→ home)
 *   4-op (an unclaimed CB still sits on the throwaway):
 *     claimClaimableBalance(CB) → payment(→ home) → changeTrust(0) → accountMerge(→ home)
 * The sponsor:
 *   1. re-parses the XDR,
 *   2. runs the SEPARATE, tight SWEEP anti-drain policy (order-pinned; the claim
 *      and send allowlists are NEVER widened),
 *   3. enforces the fee cap,
 *   4. fee-bumps + submits.
 *
 * The sponsor sources NOTHING and moves no value of its own — funds go only
 * throwaway → home (both the user's own accounts) — and it RECLAIMS the
 * throwaway's sponsored reserves on the merge. It never needs to sign the inner
 * tx (unlike /send-link): every inner op is throwaway-sourced.
