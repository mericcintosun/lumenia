/**
 * (app) route group layout — wraps the logged-in money surfaces (/home, /send, /request, /r, /sent,
 * /unlock, /account, /activity) in the single WalletProvider context + the AppShell.
 *
 * The group is on the LOCKED Periwinkle system (brand.md §4): the same self-hosted Sentient + Switzer
 * and the same next-themes light/dark the (site) group uses, plus the `.app-pw` token scope that
 * flips the app's Tailwind brand utilities to Periwinkle WITHOUT touching the global :root tokens the
 * FROZEN claim route renders against (see components/site/app-theme.css). The claim route /c/[id]
 * lives OUTSIDE this group, so it gets neither the provider, the shell, nor the theme — and stays
 * lean + byte-identical.
