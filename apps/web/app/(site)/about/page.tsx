/**
 * /about — why this exists, in plain words. Rebuilt on the Periwinkle system and moved here from
 * (marketing).
 *
 * The prose is carried over verbatim: it is honest, it is on-voice (brand.md §7 — name the fear,
 * then kill it; no hype), and it says exactly what is and is not true today. Rewriting it would
 * have been a redesign inventing new claims, which is not what this job is.

          <p>
            Sending money to family shouldn&apos;t require the people you love to become tech people.
            Today the system taxes the sender&apos;s money and the recipient&apos;s dignity — app
            installs, ID selfies, queues. We think that&apos;s backwards.
          </p>
          <p>
            Lumenia is a simple idea taken seriously: send money with a link, and let the person
            receiving it do nothing but tap. No app, no account, no wallet, nothing to pay to
            receive. The money waits in escrow on a public ledger — never in our hands — so we
            can&apos;t lend it, lose it, or freeze it.
          </p>
          <p>
            We build in the open and say plainly what&apos;s proven and what isn&apos;t. Right now
            Lumenia is a <strong>pilot on a test network</strong>; turning dollars into local
            currency will come through licensed partners, when it&apos;s genuinely reliable.
          </p>
          <p>
            It&apos;s built by a small team in the Stellar Türkiye community, for the corridor we
            know: people in Europe sending money home.
