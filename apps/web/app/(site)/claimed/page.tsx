/**
 * /claimed — a stateless explainer for the recipient wondering "what is this?" after they've
 * received money. Rebuilt on Periwinkle and moved into (site) from the root (it keeps the URL
 * /claimed — route groups don't change URLs — and now arrives with the group's chrome + dark theme).
 *
 * No account data, no key access — cheap and static. Vocabulary-law clean: money + people only.
 * The stale point is fixed: "pass it on (soon)" is gone — sending onward and asking for money both
 * ship now, so the point states them as real, not coming.
 *
 * robots index:false mirrors robots.ts (which disallows /claimed) — a recipient's own screen has no
 * business in a search index, and declaring index while robots refuses it is the contradiction the
 * /developers SEO trap taught us to avoid.
