/**
 * MintButton — the one action on /demo. Mints a REAL testnet claim link from the sponsor's
 * /demo-link (faucet-funded, aggressively rate-limited) and drops the visitor straight onto the
 * real claim screen.
 *
 * The mint + navigation logic is carried over unchanged from the page's warm-paper version. Two
 * parts of it are load-bearing and must not be "tidied":
 *   - `window.location.href`, NOT the router. The bearer key travels in the URL #fragment, and a
 *     client-side navigation would not set it on the claim page.
 *   - the balance id is truncated to its last 8 chars for the /c/[id] segment, while the FULL id
 *     goes in the `b` query param — the claim page needs both.
 *
 * The button is the only client boundary on the page; everything else stays server-rendered, so the
 * hero paints without waiting on this.
