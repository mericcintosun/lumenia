/**
 * /demo — the product's best salesman is the claim page itself (FRONTEND_PLAN §1b). One tap mints
 * a REAL testnet claim link and drops the visitor straight onto the claim screen to meet the hero
 * moment alone. Real on-chain data — no fiction.
 *
 * Rebuilt on the Periwinkle system and moved here from (marketing). This is the landing's CTA
 * target, so it has to feel like the next frame of it rather than a different site: the same hero
 * shape as /how-it-works, and the three steps below are the landing's own how-it-works beats
 * ("You send a link · They tap it · It's theirs") retold in the second person, because here YOU are
 * the recipient.
 *
 * REGISTER: this is a CONSUMER surface, so brand.md §8 applies in full — no numerals, no mono rails,
 * no parameter chips. /how-it-works earns those by being the one page that names the technology;
 * this page does not get them. The only tech word here is "test network", which the house treats as
 * an honesty term (see TestnetBanner), and the "no wallet, no signup, no gas" subtraction line,
 * which is the landing's CloseCTA promise repeated verbatim — it names what you DON'T need.
 *
 * NO ANALYTICS, deliberately: there is no demo event in lib/events.ts's allowlist, and adding one
 * client-side without the matching entry in the sponsor's ALLOWED_EVENTS is exactly the silent-drop
 * drift that file documents. The funnel's id-space problem is the owner's call (SITE_REDESIGN §8).
