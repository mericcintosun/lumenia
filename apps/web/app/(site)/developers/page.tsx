/**
 * /developers — the primitive under the product, for the people who might build on it. Rebuilt on
 * the Periwinkle system and moved here from (marketing).
 *
 * Along with /how-it-works, this is a page where the technical register is on-brand (the memory
 * note: "teknik estetik sadece how-it-works/developers"). It still does not get to overclaim: the
 * API does not exist, and the copy says so in as many words.
 *
 * The GitHub link now points at the actual repository. It used to be `https://github.com/` — a
 * button labelled "View the code on GitHub" that landed you on GitHub's homepage. The real URL is
 * the one in the git remote, and README.md and EVIDENCE.md both already publish it.

            That primitive is useful well beyond consumer transfers. Refunds, earnings, rewards, gig
            payouts — anywhere you owe money to someone who never signed up for the rails you happen
            to use.
          </p>
          <p>
            We&apos;re building toward a small API and SDK so any product can send a{" "}
            <strong>payout by link</strong>, without asking the person on the other end to make a
            wallet first.

            It&apos;s early, and it&apos;s open. The code that powers the pilot — the sponsor
            service, the anti-drain validator, the claim flow — is public today. Real API docs will
            land alongside the API itself; we won&apos;t publish a docs site for something that
            doesn&apos;t exist yet.
