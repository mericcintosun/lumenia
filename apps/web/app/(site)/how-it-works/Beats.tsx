/**
 * Beats — the four technical beats of /how-it-works, as an audit trail that draws itself.
 *
 * Each beat carries a soft-3D icon from the brand-kit set, and the connector between one mark and
 * the next DRAWS DOWN as that beat arrives — the trail being written as you read it. The numerals
 * are the page's own register: brand.md §8 bans mono rails and "01/02/03" numerals on CONSUMER
 * sections (which is why the landing's own how-it-works section has none), and this is the one page
 * whose job is to look like an audit.
 *
 * The icon semantics follow the ones the landing already established in Fears:
 *   check → it's real / publicly checkable · key → who can open it · hand → receiving, free
 *   shield → safe, we never hold it
 *
 * MOTION RULE, learned twice in this codebase and not to be relearned: only aria-hidden decoration
 * animates on opacity. Fading text to make it appear costs contrast at every frame it is faded —
 * the landing's HowItWorks quietens its steps with COLOUR for exactly this reason, and a dissolve
 * wrapped around this page's CTA already failed Lighthouse once (a11y 96). Every heading, paragraph
 * and chip below paints at full strength immediately; the icons and the rail are the only things
 * that move, and they owe no contrast because they carry no information.

        A new Stellar account normally needs a reserve of the network&apos;s native asset (XLM)
        before it can hold anything, plus a fee for every transaction. Lumenia&apos;s sponsor
        service covers both — <strong>sponsored reserves</strong> for the account and its trustline,
        and a <strong>fee-bump</strong> wrapped around the claim. The recipient ends up holding 0 XLM
        and pays nothing to receive.

        The sponsor signs, so the question worth asking is what it <strong>refuses</strong>{" "}
        to sign. An allowlist validator checks every transaction against the source and the parameters of each
        operation, not just its type: the sponsor may only source the sponsorship and
        account-creation operations, a created account must start at zero, and anything that would
        move value is rejected outright. A constraint it cannot verify is a rejection, not an
        exception. The sponsor is never a signer on a user&apos;s account.
