/**
 * /how-it-works — THE trust page, and the ONLY surface allowed to name the tech (CLAUDE.md,
 * brand.md §3): Stellar, USDC, Claimable Balances, sponsored reserves, the explorer. It also
 * serves grant reviewers and partners, so the register is technical on purpose — this is the one
 * page where the numerals and parameter chips banned on consumer sections are on-brand.
 *
 * Rebuilt on the Periwinkle system and moved here from (marketing), which is still on the retired
 * warm-paper chrome. Route groups don't affect URLs, so the page kept /how-it-works and simply
 * arrived with the right chrome (SiteNav, the theme, Sentient + Switzer) already around it.
 *
 * No mock data: both transaction hashes below are real, resolve on stellar.expert, and are the
 * same ones the landing's proof strip and EVIDENCE.md cite.
