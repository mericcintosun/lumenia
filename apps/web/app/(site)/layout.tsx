/**
 * (site) route group — the public site on the LOCKED "Periwinkle" system (brand.md): Sentient +
 * Switzer (self-hosted), the `--pw-*` palette, `next-themes` via data-theme, SiteNav + Footer.
 *
 * This is now the whole public site: the old (marketing) warm-paper group has been fully migrated
 * in here and DELETED (route groups don't affect URLs, so each page moved without its URL changing
 * and arrived with the right chrome already around it). The only warm-paper left in the product is
 * the frozen claim route.
 *
 * The claim route /c/[id] lives outside this group and stays webfont-free + frozen: nothing here
 * may reach it.
 *
 * Route-specific metadata (title, canonical, OG) belongs in each page.tsx — Next merges metadata
 * shallowly, so a page that redefines `openGraph` replaces the whole object rather than extending
 * it. Only genuinely group-wide fields live here.

 * also wraps the frozen claim route, which is grant evidence and is not in this task's blast
 * radius. It is worth fixing there too (a recipient reading an amount has more reason to zoom than
 * anyone) — that just needs the claim regression re-run alongside it.
