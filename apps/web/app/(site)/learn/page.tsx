/**
 * /learn — the guide index. Rebuilt on the Periwinkle system and moved here from (marketing).
 *
 * A stack of rows, not a card grid: brand.md §8 rules out three identical cards in a symmetric
 * grid, and a list of articles is a list — the row is the affordance. The old page wrapped each
 * guide in a MoneyCard, which is the retired warm-paper component (and the last thing on this route
 * that referenced it).
 *
 * Content comes from lib/learn.ts, unchanged — it is editorial copy, not data, and it is already
 * vocabulary-law safe (money + people, no crypto terms).
