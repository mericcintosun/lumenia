/**
 * Landing (/) — the LOCKED Periwinkle landing, composed from per-section components under
 * components/site/sections/. This file is intentionally thin: it only wires the section order and
 * the overlay-reveal structure. The opening IS the Apple-style scroll-scrub hero — a sticky mascot
 * Greeting the ScrubHero scrolls up over. Sticky greeting z0; everything after rides in .op-over z1
 * (overlay-reveal, our locked transition). Shared styles live in ./sections/landing.css.
 *
 * Section order (top→bottom, brand.md §12 narrative):
 *   1 Greeting + ScrubHero + HeroResolution — the hero (subtraction → "Money home, in a link.")
 *   2 Fears        — the four fears, named then struck through
 *   3 Moment       — the real human beat (treated photograph)
 *   4 HowItWorks   — pinned 3-step scroll story
 *   5 Proof        — the one Stellar-dark strip + real on-chain receipt
 *   6 Trust        — "Where is my money, exactly?" essay + FAQ
 *   7 CloseCTA + Footer — dual CTA over the living video + the dark footer
