/**
 * /roadmap — the line between what works today and what is still ahead. Rebuilt on the Periwinkle
 * system and moved here from (marketing).
 *
 * The items are carried over verbatim. This page's whole job is the honesty rule (CLAUDE.md: no
 * overclaiming; keep the proven/unverified line truthful), so the copy is not the redesign's to
 * touch — and neither is the boundary it draws.
 *
 * The status reaches the reader as a LABEL, not as colour alone (WCAG 1.4.1). The dot is a second,
 * redundant channel. The old page carried the distinction in the dot only, which meant the one
 * thing this page exists to say was the one thing a colour-blind reader could not read.
 *
 * No green for "Proven" either — the standing no-brand-green rule (brand.md §4.3) holds, so the
 * accent carries what shipped.
