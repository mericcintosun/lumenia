            <strong>This is a pilot on a test network.</strong> The money here is test money with no
            real value. Don&apos;t send anything you can&apos;t afford to treat as a demo.
          </p>
          <p>
            <strong>We are not a bank or a money-transfer business.</strong> Lumenia doesn&apos;t hold
            your money — it moves between people on a public ledger. We provide the software that sets
            up accounts and covers network costs.
          </p>
          <p>
            <strong>A money link is like cash.</strong> Whoever holds the link can claim it. Keep it
            private and share it only with the person it&apos;s for. Once claimed, it&apos;s claimed.
          </p>
          <p>
            <strong>Your password is yours alone.</strong> If you lock your money with a password and
            forget it, nobody — including Lumenia — can recover it.
          </p>
          <p>
            <strong>No guarantees during the pilot.</strong> We build carefully and verify in public,
            but this is early software provided as-is while we test.
