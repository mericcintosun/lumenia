/**
 * robots.txt (Next native). Until now there was none, so /robots.txt 404'd into the not-found page.
 *
 * The important line is `/c/` — a claim URL is a BEARER link. The secret itself rides in the
 * `#fragment` and never leaves the browser, so a crawler could not spend one, but the URL still
 * names an amount, a sender and a balance id, and those are a stranger's money. They have no
 * business in an index. Disallowing here keeps the claim route's own HTML untouched (it is grant
 * evidence and frozen) while still keeping it out of search.
 *
 * /spike and /dev are 404 in production already; listing them is belt-and-braces.
 *
 * `/dev$` is anchored, and that matters. A robots rule is a PREFIX match, so a bare `/dev` also
 * disallowed `/developers` — a public marketing page that sitemap.ts has been submitting the whole
 * time. robots wins that argument, so the page was asking to be indexed and being refused, and
 * nothing surfaced it: Lighthouse only reports it as SEO 69 on that one route. `$` ends the match,
 * so this now blocks exactly /dev and nothing that merely starts with it.
