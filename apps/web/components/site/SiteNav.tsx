/**
 * SiteNav — the (site) group's persistent top nav. A 3-column grid keeps the links optically
 * centered (logo left · links centre · actions right). Each link has an animated underline + color
 * hover. Built on the `.site-theme` Periwinkle scope so it stays on-brand.
 *
 * On the landing it starts hidden and slides + fades in (Motion) once you scroll past the immersive
 * opening hero, which carries its own wordmark and must not be covered. Every other route in the
 * group opens on ordinary content with no wordmark of its own, so the nav is simply there — the
 * scroll gate would leave those pages chrome-less until you scrolled, with no way back to the site.
