/**
 * Moment — section 3, "the moment": the human beat (brand.md §12.3). The brand's own soft-3D
 * "passing light" illustration — one pair of hands giving a glowing orb to another — with the copy
 * in a soft glass panel over a periwinkle scrim + slow Ken-Burns. Three "friction removed" chips
 * (soft-3D check icon) stagger in as the human-relief payoff.
 *
 * This used to be a photoreal stock image of hands and a phone. It sat in /brand-kit-assets but was
 * not OF the brand kit: photography against a system built from soft-3D illustration, papercraft
 * and the mascot — and its phone screen carried the garbled pseudo-text that gives generated
 * imagery away. il-hands is the brand's own asset and says the line better: the money is literally
 * being handed over.
