  { icon: "/brand-kit-assets/icon-shield.webp", lead: "Not with us.", body: "Your money moves into escrow on a public ledger the moment you send. We never hold it — so we can’t lend it, invest it, or lose it." },
  { icon: "/brand-kit-assets/icon-key.webp", lead: "Only two people can move it.", body: "Your recipient can claim it. If they don’t within 7 days, you take it back. Nobody else — including us." },
  { icon: "/brand-kit-assets/icon-check.webp", lead: "Every claim is checkable.", body: "Each transfer is a public record. Don’t believe this page — open it and verify it yourself." },

const FAQ = [
  { q: "What if I lose the link, or send it to the wrong chat?", a: "Treat a money link like cash in an envelope: whoever holds it can claim it, so share it in a private message with the person it’s for. If it goes wrong — wrong chat, lost phone — don’t panic: if nobody has claimed it, the money automatically becomes reclaimable by you after 7 days. Once someone claims it, though, it’s claimed — exactly like handing over cash." },
  { q: "Is this a bank?", a: "No — and that’s deliberate. Banks hold your money; we never do. When you send with Lumenia, the money sits in escrow on a public ledger until your recipient claims it. That means no deposit insurance, because there’s no deposit — and no bank, because there’s nothing we’re holding. We’re a way to move money, not a place to bank it." },
  { q: "What does it cost?", a: "During the pilot: nothing. Receiving will always be free — your recipient never pays to accept money, and we cover the small network cost behind the scenes. When we introduce a sending fee, it will be a single number shown to you before you confirm, never deducted from what your recipient gets." },
  { q: "What does my recipient actually need?", a: "A phone with a browser. That’s the whole list. No app, no account beforehand, no ID upload to see the money. They tap the link, see the amount, and claim it with their face or a password they choose." },
  { q: "The money is “held in dollars” — what does that mean?", a: "It means the amount doesn’t wobble with crypto markets or shrink in a volatile currency while it waits. Your recipient can hold it as dollars and send it onward whenever they like. It is not a savings product: it earns nothing, and we’d be suspicious of anyone who told you otherwise." },
  { q: "Can my recipient turn it into lira in their bank account?", a: "Not inside Lumenia yet — we’re honest about that. Cash-out will be handled through licensed local partners, and we’ll ship it when it’s genuinely reliable, not before. Today, recipients can hold dollars and send money onward to others." },
  { q: "What happens if Lumenia disappears tomorrow?", a: "Your money doesn’t, because we never had it. It lives on a public ledger under your recipient’s control (or yours, for unclaimed links). This is the single most important design decision we made, and it’s the reason this FAQ answer can exist." },
  { q: "Is this real, or a demo?", a: "Both, honestly. The technology is live and every claim in this page’s proof is backed by real, publicly verifiable transfers — currently on a test network with test money. We’d rather show you a working pilot and say so plainly than launch quietly with your rent money." },
