 * fired by /send and accepted by the sponsor, but dropped silently HERE, so it was never measured.
 *
 * Honest caveat on what these can answer. The claim events carry a hashed CLAIM id; the send events
 * carry a hashed ACCOUNT. Two different id spaces, so they cannot be joined: this measures how many
 * claims and how many sends happen, NOT whether the same person did both. The real claim→first-send
 * funnel needs one shared id, and the only place to mint it is the claim route — which is frozen
 * grant evidence and out of this change's reach.
 *
 * The request_* events are different, deliberately: all three carry the hashed request NONCE — one
 * id space — so created → opened → paid IS joinable end-to-end (REQUEST_MONEY.md §5.3). A third id
 * space overall; still never joinable to a person. `request_paid` fires when the payer's money is
 * escrowed (for a first-time ask that is link-created time; the asker's own claim still lands in
 * the unjoined claim-id space).
