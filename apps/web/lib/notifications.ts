/**
 * Notifications — NOT a server feed. Every item is DERIVED from the public ledger (the same Horizon
 * reads /home + /activity already use), plus a purely local "seen" set in localStorage. No backend,
 * no push subscription, no per-user database — which is exactly the product's privacy posture (money
 * lives on the public record; we hold nothing).
 *
 * Three kinds of item, all real:
 *   - "waiting"     — an open Claimable Balance you can collect right now (a paid request, or a
 *                     transfer straight to your account). Source: loadIncomingClaims.
 *   - "reclaimable" — money YOU sent that was never claimed and whose 7-day window is up, so it can
 *                     come back to you (gasless, via /feebump — proven). Source: loadReclaimableSends.
 *   - "received"    — money that already landed in your account. Source: loadActivity (incoming effects).
 *
 * Unread = an item whose id you have not marked seen on this device. There is deliberately no
 * cross-device sync: a notification is a hint derived from the ledger, not a record we keep for you.
