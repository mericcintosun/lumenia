/**
 * Off-ramp exit adapters (architecture-review conditions #3 + #4).
 *
 * OUTSIDE the trust boundary. Off-ramp is the user's own edge choice; every
 * value move here is signed by the RECIPIENT's own key (never the sponsor KMS).
 * Each path is an independent, removable adapter behind one interface — if a
 * card/exchange policy changes, the core claim flow is unaffected.
 *
 * v1 user-facing cash-out = the card adapter ("spend", fits the hold-dollars
 * thesis, sidesteps the 72h bank-withdrawal hold). The CCTP adapter is the
 * partner-independent fallback proven (Stellar-side) by Spike #4.
 *
 * NOTE (code review): the CCTP amount decimal scale (USDC 6 vs Stellar SAC 7) is
 * UNVERIFIED until a funded burn — confirm before any real value moves.
