/**
 * Recovery-password strength floor (security review F1). The password copy of the seed is
 * server-stored ciphertext an attacker can fetch and crack OFFLINE (Argon2id-bounded only) —
 * so "your password is the only key to your money" is TRUE only if the password is strong.
 * A 6-char or common password is instant to crack = fund theft.
 *
 * This is a dependency-free heuristic floor (a full zxcvbn score is the ideal, noted). It runs
 * CLIENT-SIDE only: the server is zero-knowledge and never sees the password — its only lever is
 * the Argon2id param minimum (see apps/sponsor recovery-store.ts). Applies to SETTING a recovery
 * password (secure), not to entering an existing one (restore).
