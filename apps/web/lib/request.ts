/**
 * Request money — "ask someone to pay you with a link" (REQUEST_MONEY.md §10).
 *
 * THE DECISION this module implements (§5.1, argued in writing as required):
 *
 * A request link carries NO custody. It is `/r/<nonce>?a=<amount>&n=<name>` — public
 * metadata only, nothing to steal, nothing to lose. Who the money ends up with is
 * decided by what the ASKER already has:
 *
 *  - FIRST-TIME asker (no local account): the payer pays through the existing
 *    `createSendLink()` — a bearer claim link — and sends it back into the same
 *    chat thread the request arrived from. The thread is the return channel.
 *    Value-first holds: the asker sets up nothing until money exists.
 *  - RETURNING asker (`useWallet()` has an address): the link also carries
 *    `to=<G...>`, and the payer's send creates the Claimable Balance with the
 *    ASKER'S ADDRESS as the unconditional claimant (payer keeps the reclaim-7d
 *    claimant). The asker collects it on /home with her existing account. Both
 *    policy gates accept this shape UNCHANGED — proven on testnet by Spike #6
 *    (apps/sponsor/src/spike6-request-pay.ts, 8/8).
 *
 * Why not a bearer-key request (option A): the request link must never carry the
 * secret (the payer could take the money back), so A needs TWO links — one to
 * share, one to keep — on the surface that can least afford confusion; and
 * localStorage inside a WhatsApp webview is not durable enough to hold the only
 * key to money. Why not an account at request time (option B): it violates
 * value-first (custody before any money exists) and burns a sponsored reserve per
 * possibly-never-paid request — a griefing vector priced in the sponsor's XLM.
 *
 * SEP-7 (§5.2): NOT in v1. A `web+stellar:pay` URI cannot express the first-time
 * ask at all (no destination account), and for returning askers it delivers a
 * plain payment with no reclaim predicate — the payer would silently lose the
 * "comes back after 7 days" promise. The `to` param already carries everything a
 * SEP-7 URI needs, so offering "pay from any Stellar wallet" later is additive.
 *
 * The nonce is the request funnel's shared id (§5.3): request_created /
 * request_opened / request_paid all carry its hash, so created → opened → paid is
 * joinable end-to-end — the first fully joinable funnel in the product.
