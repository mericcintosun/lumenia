/**
 * /stats data — aggregated SERVER-SIDE from the public ledger, no DB, no mock.
 *
 * The sponsor's operation history is the source: every account the service funds
 * is a `create_account` op, every payment link is a `create_claimable_balance` op,
 * both attached to the sponsor because it pays their reserves + fees. We paginate
 * that feed and reduce it to plain COUNTS before anything leaves this module — the
 * feed carries recipient addresses, and none of them may reach the client (a
 * directory/leaderboard of money users was explicitly rejected; aggregates only).
 *
 * Honest scope (no-overclaim rule): `accountsCreated` counts every account the
 * service funded on the TEST network — including our own testing — NOT unique
 * people. There is no identity here, so a real user count is not something we can
 * prove, and we don't claim one. Claims-completed and the request funnel are NOT
 * derivable from this feed (a claim executes on the recipient account and the
 * sponsor only fee-bumps it, so it isn't a participant of that op) — they are
 * deliberately omitted rather than estimated.
 *
 * Server-only: called from the /stats server component with `revalidate = 300`, so
 * the ledger walk runs at most once every 5 minutes regardless of traffic.
