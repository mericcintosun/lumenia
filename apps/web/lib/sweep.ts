/**
 * Client-side consolidation — the "one wallet" sweep (RECOVERY_ARCHITECTURE §3.2;
 * proven on-chain by Spike #7). Each claim link carries its OWN bearer key, so a
 * returning claim lands the money in a fresh per-link THROWAWAY account. This sweeps
 * that throwaway into the user's ONE persistent home account and closes it, in a
 * single transaction the throwaway sources itself and the sponsor fee-bumps.
 *
 * The throwaway holds 0 XLM throughout; the sponsor sources NOTHING, moves no value
 * of its own (funds go only throwaway → home, both the user's own accounts), and
 * RECLAIMS the throwaway's reserves on the merge. The separate, tight SWEEP
 * anti-drain policy (§5) pins the exact op sequence. Mirrors lib/send.ts / lib/claim.ts
 * so the same proven endpoint shape runs in a real browser.
 *
 * The seed reaches this module only to derive the throwaway keypair + sign; it is
 * never persisted, logged, or sent anywhere, and is zeroed after signing.
