/**
 * Live-claim regression harness (owner-approved). Runs the automated form of
 * Guardrail 2: after every deploy, mint a FRESH real claim link and claim it in a
 * real browser against the deployed sponsor + web. Targets the live URLs by
 * default (override with WEB_URL / SPONSOR_URL); needs USDC_ISSUER_SECRET in the
 * env (HANDOFF §3) so the minted Claimable Balance matches the sponsor's trustline.
 *
 * This is a post-deploy gate, not a per-save test — each run consumes friendbot
 * funding + one on-chain Claimable Balance (testnet, worthless).
